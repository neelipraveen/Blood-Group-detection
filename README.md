# Blood Group Detection from Fingerprints ðŸ©¸

A web application that uses a Deep Learning model to predict a person's blood group based on an image of their fingerprint. The app allows users to upload an image, enter patient details, and generate a downloadable PDF medical report with the predicted blood group.

This project is built with Python, Flask, and TensorFlow/Keras.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### **1. Clone the Repository**

First, **clone** the repository to your computer instead of downloading a ZIP file. This links it directly to GitHub, making it easy to manage.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/neelipraveen/Blood-Group-detection.git](https://github.com/neelipraveen/Blood-Group-detection.git)
cd Blood-Group-detection
2. Create a Virtual Environment
It's best practice to create a separate environment for the project's packages. This keeps everything clean and organized.

Bash

# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Activate it (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Requirements
Install all the necessary Python packages with a single command.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the App
Now you can start the Flask web server!

Bash

python app-Mine.py
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see the application live!
